> A platform-agnostic, simple tool to manage secrets with git.

I was trying to work on a project with some fellow developers working on PCs. Unfortunately, existing tools are limited by platform, require extremely convoluted setup/installers, or just plain-old don't work.

Introducing `git-castle`! The easiest, lightweight way to manage secrets without the necessity for a full Key Management Solution.

### 🏠 [Homepage](https://github.com/ajaymerchia/git-castle#readme)

## ⚙️ Install 
*One Line Setup! (Thank Goodness)*
```sh
npm install -g git-castle
```

## 📝 Usage
### ⚡️ Quick Setup

```sh
git-castle init
git-castle add-user -u $YOUR_USERNAME
git add .git-castle

git-castle guard $PATHSPEC_TO_SECRET_FILES # Sets the specified file as a secret
git add .git-castle-secrets

git-castle add-hook # Recommended to reduce manual encrypting and decrypting on every commit.

git-castle lockdown # Encrypts the files
git add $PATHSPEC_TO_ENCRYPTED_SECRETS # Adds encrypted files to repositories.
```

When commiting your files, make sure you **DO NOT commit the raw secret files 🔐**. You should add those to your `.gitignore`. 

Files generated by `git-castle` (ending with `.secret`) can be safely checked-in. 💪

### ➕ Add A New User
#### On your Machine
```sh
# Inside the repository you wish to share with the user
git-castle receive-key

# After the New User is successfully added
git add .git-castle
git commit -m "Added $USERNAME to git-castle"
git push
```

Share your `$RECEIVER_ID` with the New User.

#### On the New User's Machine
```sh
git-castle keygen -u $USERNAME -o $OUTFILE.cstl.pub
# if -o is omitted, the public key will be stored in ~/.git-castle/$USERNAME.cstl.pub

git-castle send-key -u $USERNAME -k $OUTFILE.cstl.pub -r $RECEIVER_ID


# After the other user pushes the config update following the send-key operation:
git clone $REMOTE_REPOSITORY # pull if already downloaded
git-castle login -u $USERNAME
git-castle reveal

git-castle add-hook # Recommended for the future
```

## How it Works

![Alt text](design.png "Security Architecture")
- The first encryptor generates the `master_key` which will be used to encrypt/decrypt all secrets stored in the repository.
- To add another user, a `git-castle` user with access to the `master_key` creates an `encrypted master_key (EMK)` using a 4096bit RSA key and stores it in the `.git-castle` directory. That user can then access secrets by decrypting the `EMK` using their RSA private key.
- To add a new secret, a `git-castle` user simply encrypts the secret with the `master_key` and uploads the secret to the repository. All secrets are encrypted using `aes-256-cbc`.
